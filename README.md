# LGN Analysis Scripts â€“ Supplementary Material

This repository contains all Python scripts used in the research project titled:

**"Structural Analysis of the Human Lateral Geniculate Nucleus Using MRI-Based Segmentation"**

Each script corresponds to a specific appendix in the supplemental materials section of the research paper. Together, they form a complete pipeline for LGN segmentation, volume and shape analysis, statistical processing, and 3D visualization in MNI space.

## How to Use

Each script is standalone and corresponds to a specific analysis module. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including:

- `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`
- `nibabel`, `nilearn`, `fslpy` (for neuroimaging work)
- `seaborn`, `ptitprince` (for visualizations like raincloud plots)

You can run scripts individually via:

```bash
python appendix_b_volume_analyses.py
